Overview
This repository showcases my progress through Stanford University's CS231n course, covering Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the context of deep learning for computer vision.

Key Learning Objectives
1. Theory and Intuition
Mathematics of Neural Networks: Activation functions, backpropagation, loss functions, and optimization techniques.
Model Performance: Overfitting, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.
2. Hands-On Implementation
Building CNNs and RNNs: Implemented from scratch in Python and using PyTorch.
Model Optimization: Leveraged PyTorch for complex networks and streamlined development.
3. Advanced Techniques
Research Applications: Experimented with object detection, image segmentation, and transfer learning.
