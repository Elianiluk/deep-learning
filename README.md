# Deep Learning with Neural Networks: CS231n Coursework
This repository showcases my work and learning progress through Stanford University's CS231n course on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. This well-regarded course provided a deep dive into the foundational concepts and practical applications of deep learning, specifically within the context of computer vision and image recognition tasks.

## Overview
Through this course, I focused on understanding and implementing a variety of neural network models and techniques, including:

### Core Concepts of Neural Networks:
Gained a comprehensive understanding of neural networks, their architecture, and the underlying theories that power deep learning.
### CNNs and RNNs:
Explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), covering their application in image recognition, natural language processing, and sequence-based tasks.
### Implementing Neural Networks: 
Learned to implement neural network architectures using both foundational Python and advanced deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, allowing for flexibility and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.
## Key Learning Objectives
### 1. Theory and Intuition
